# Welcome to my portfolio

Hello World! This is my portfolio page, made purely with HTML and CSS, hosted on GitHub.io. 
The page gives some information about me, my coding journey and my backgtround in engineering.

This has been a great project for me, a real playground for CSS concepts. Having followed a GDG tutorial midway through my course at CodeClan top create it initially, I have since been able to come back and personalise it more and add in details of my projects.
