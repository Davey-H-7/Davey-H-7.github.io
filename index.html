                    <p>
                        Havng grown up opn the East Coast in Fife, I moved to Glasgow for uni where I studied EEE (Electronic and Electrical Engineering) at Strathclyde university. After graduating with a BEng (Honours) I went to work as an Engineer in Building Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With 5 years work experience under my belt I then made the life-changing decision to transfer my skills into Software Engineering and undertook CodeClan's 16-week Professional Software Development course where I discovered my passion and aptitude for coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work and coding, I have had a lifelong love of video gaming, especially Nintendo. Also I am currently a member of Glasgow's premier dodgeball team, the Kelvin Rapids, regularly representing them in National competitions (see action shot).
